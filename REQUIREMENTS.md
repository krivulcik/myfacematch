# myfacematch requirements

Some requirements that will be added to the spec.

* Registered users who will be able to upload and approve photos, based on permissions.
* Some kind of photo similarity detection (maybe).
* Additional information for the photos - the characters/persons/objects will be decomposed and have more information (name, bio, episode information for people; possibly location, history for buildings etc.).
* Info screen for the characters: basic information presentation + information about the photos uploaded for the character.
